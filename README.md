## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** CSS, EJS, Express, Passport(authentication), MongoDB(Mongoose)

This is a MVC fullstack CRUD todo app built with local authentication. It fetches from an API to display the home screen inspirational quote. It uses MongoDB to store the items as well as the project groups. Mongoose schemas are used to validate data, and to give the Mongo documents structure. On the front end EJS is used for templating. Express is used on the back end.

## Lessons Learned:

This project helped me learned how to implement authentication and work with external libraries. My backend skills along with my ability to use the methods and the core functionality of MongoDb(Mongoose) also improved drastically. On the frontend my DOM manipulations skills and CSS media-queries abilities were put to the test. Lastly deploying a fullstack app also allowed me to better understand node (npm scripts) and other essential concepts of development.
